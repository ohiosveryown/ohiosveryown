### Atlas is a platform designed to help conquer the challenges of the customer support experience. I collaborated with Atlas' leadership to establish design principles, define the product vision, create 0 → 1 products, and deliver polished experiences.

#### ↬ Where did we start?

① I was approached by one of the co-founders as they were just starting a seed round to help define and execute on a product vision. We joke that we started from just an idea and a logo.

After getting more acclimated with the customer support space, I thought it was a good idea to define design principles with the co-founders to set a foundation for how we think about design problems. In total we landed on five guiding principles, but here's a peak at just a couple.

#### ↬ What did we do?

② The next step was to work with the co-founders on plotting out the typical journey customer support agents would have. We based our assumptions in recent and lived experience, as well as interviewing prospective customers.

From there we started designing feature by feature, building momentum. We moved hyper-fast – to quote one of our customers, "...their time to market for feature requests is often same day, which is bananas." And it was true. At our fastest, I'd see designs I worked on that morning be in production that evening or the next day.

#### ↬ What difference did we make?

③ Atlas as a company has been really successful since it’s inception a few years ago, thanks in part to the design strategy and execution. Atlas was a member of the YC’22 batch and backed by founders from Rippling, Lattice, Dropbox, and more. We set out to make Atlas a modern support platform that provides fast and efficient customer service solutions, giving superhuman support.
