### 000 is a collection of portraits by photographer and friend of this website, Roy Handy. The project aimed to give women, specifically women of color, a platform to express the cultural appreciation of owning their true self, through their hair. Roy originally published a book of portraits of women talking about embracing their nature hair, and we eventually got on the path of creating a web presence to coincide with the book.
