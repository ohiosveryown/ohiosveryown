### <a href="https://threezeros.co" target="_blank">000</a> is a project by photographer and friend of this website, Roy Handy. The project aimed to give women, specifically women of color, a platform to express the cultural appreciation of owning their true self, through their hair. Roy originally published a book of portraits of women talking about embracing their nature hair, and we eventually got on the path of creating a web presence to coincide with the book.

#### ↬ Where did we start?

① Roy initially made a prototype in After Effects showing what he was thinking for the interaction. After tweaking it a little bit, I started thinking about how I’d go about building the web app.

I knew I’d use Vue to build, but I also wanted to create something that would be easy to update for someone that might not be super technical. So after doing some research, I decided to go with a static site generator for Vue, called Saber.

#### ↬ What did we do?

② I fleshed out the three main page layouts: the index page, detail pages and the about page. I also to thought about how the transitions happen across the page layouts. The goal for the visual design was to create an editorial type layout / experience.
