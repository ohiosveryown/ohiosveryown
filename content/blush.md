# Blush

## But why is it called grotesque?

### "Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon July 1969, A.D. We came in peace for all mankind." I remember the first time I really became cognizant of the design of a typeface: it was when I saw the Lunar Plaque that accompanied Apollo 11 to the moon. The font used was Futura. While I never formally studied type design, creating a typeface has been something I've wanted to do for awhile now.
