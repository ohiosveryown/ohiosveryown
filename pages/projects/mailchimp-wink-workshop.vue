      <h3 class="subtitle">Design systems can be great—they're useful for both new and seasoned designers. They help refocus design efforts from mundane things like styling inputs and buttons, to more exciting challenges like interaction and prototyping. However, knowing how to use the system is probably just as important as the system itself. While working on the design architecture team, I helped plan and facilitate workshops for all of product design and (some of) engineering to learn how to use Mailchimp’s design system.</h3>

    <section class="works">
      <p class="p">As with most projects, a good first step is to define the problem. Being one of five on the design architecture team, we noticed designers had problems finding resources around the design system (Wink), how to use it, and how to contribute to it. As a group, we thought workshops would be a good way to mitigate some of these issues.</p>
      <p class="p space">We began planning and documenting how the workshops might be conducted, how we should split the presentations / activities up, and how we could create a living document in the system around education.</p>

          Planning doc we worked from – my contribution was planning for the first week’s demo and activity around grids, spacing and layout

      <p class="p">It seems obvious, but hammering home fundamentals was a big deal for week 1 of the workshop. Mailchimp's designers typically lean super heavy into design thinking and methodology, so sometimes visual design doesn't get as much attention as it deserves. Coaching designers on how to utilize grids, spacing and layout was my personal goal.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-3 subtitle space">We decided early on that having the workshop live completely in Figma made a lot of sense. We conducted the lectures as well as the workshop activities all in Figma. Figma is where the design system lives – so meet the user where they already are.</h4>
