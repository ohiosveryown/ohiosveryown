      <h3 class="subtitle">As a self-initiated project, I began thinking about how interaction and motion work in the Mailchimp product. Working from our internal design themes of "combined tasks", "helpful & educational", and "personalization", it become obvious that we needed interaction guidance for fostering and guiding a user along a virtuous marketing cycle, while doing so consistently across design and engineering.</h3>

      <p class="p">Before I started exploring a framework, there was nothing to help guide designers, engineers and content strategists in relation to interaction and motion. To begin, I met with design directors and our VP of design to make a case for the importance of a system: why it would help both our designers and customers who use the Mailchimp web app.</p>
      <p class="p space">Along with tying our interaction rules to our design principles, I made the case that interaction and animation in our product should be unobtrusive, helpful and accessible.</p>

          Prototype from my initial presentation with design leadership showing how we might leverage interaction and design in the Mailchimp app. I wanted to illustrate the different areas in the app using unique interaction characteristics, but showing how they still could feel homogeneous

      <p class="p">In a conversation with one of our design directors, I remember him saying how we could leverage cinematic metaphors for how we use the interaction system in our product. This made a lot of sense to me. These metaphors were ubiquitous, standardized and they help leverage patterns and verbiage that had been established through the history of film. I began to map cinematic themes with our how customers in the app might experience forms of interaction: i.e. opening a scene to a page or component entering.</p>
      <p class="p space">Once I got buy-in from leadership, I began refining the various elements of the interaction system: starting with primitives such as easing and duration.</p>

          Easing and timing values are akin to font-family and font-size. I find this level of abstraction is always a good place to start for any type of design system.

      <p class="p">After defining the interaction values and components, I turned to our internal engineering prototyping tool, and opened up my code editor. Because interaction, animation and transition is dynamic, I felt it was import to highlight how the experience felt, and this just isn't something you can do with a static comp or mockup.</p>
      <p class="p space">Finally, I built a place for our interaction framework to live and talk to our greater design system. I wanted to validate the interplay of both systems and create a documented source for designers and engineers to reference.</p>

          Motion & Interaction guidelines on the web

      </figure>

      <p class="subtitle space">While the guidelines live on the web where they can be experienced, interpreted, and evolved, I also wanted to make them easily accessible for everyone, not just designers and engineers. I built a little Slack integration to quickly find values and timings that might be required just by typing "[slash] motion". Up next is the Figma plug-in ðŸŽ¨.</p>

      <p class="p space">I should also mention accessibility was top of mind when working through the animation and transition values. Just like this site, if a user has a preference for reduced-motion, the amount of non-essential motion is either reduced significantly or removed all together.</p>
