      <p>Vibes is a collaborative application focusing on composing and editing mood boards. A large challenge with tools out there today for creating mood boards is they often are siloed or isolated to very few people.</p>
      <p>The first thing I did when starting this project was to conduct research studies with various designers who use mood boards to find out what they're needs are. I found most users wanted a simple but highly collaborative experience.</p>
      <p>Once I had some research to inform my decision making, I began sketching out user journeys to account for the various flows and screens that would be required. The biggest factor I accounted for was stripping away the unnecessary features that often times go unused for a mood board application.</p>

        <p>Competitive analysis and user research also helped guide the importance of including a tagging system in the application. The majority of people I spoke with would often times be frustrated and abandon similar applications when a tagging feature wasn't included.</p>
        <p>Obviously it's extremely vital to be able to quickly search and find different images or patterns by tags, especially when collaborating with a large number of people.</p>
        <p>Tagging in Vibes is very easy to do. You simple tap a photo to initialize the detail view. If there are any tags already marked, they'll appear right above the image. If not, you simply click the blue tag button and begin typing to label the&nbsp;image.</p>

      <p>Vibes is intended to be a cross-platform application and to cut down on the rewriting of code, I decided to use various UI paradigms rather than native, OS styled components.</p>
      <p>From our user testing, we found that although we shifted away from typically iOS and Android UI design patterns, the visual interface was simple and clear to users as to not prohibit them from having a pleasant and successful user experience.</p>
      <p>One piece of feedback we receive was in regards to the main tools button found on various screens. Initially, I had just designed a floating action button with a plus in the center. Most people assumed this would create an additional mood board or potentially allow them to add a collaborator. In actuality, it allows a user to achieve all those functions and more. A simple solution was to add a label, "tools", to the button. The feedback we received after this change was users now had much more clarity on the actions they could execute.</p>

      <p>Vibes is still early in it's development lifecycle and as such, I'm still testing on things such as usability and functionality. It's been invaluable talking to various designers to get feedback on the application as it's being developed. This allows the developer and I to iterate on a much quicker cadence and create a better overall product.</p>
      <p>The plan is to release feature sets in stages and iterate and build on top, rather than trying to design and build the perfect application all at once. I'm excited to see how far and robust we can make the application without sacrificing ease of use—a challenge for sure.</p>
